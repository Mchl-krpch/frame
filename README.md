# frame
ðŸ’» Simple frame in dosbox
This is my first project on assembly. I learned addressing, registers, stack and array access, some instructions like [stos](https://faydoc.tripod.com/cpu/stosw.htm)

## optional
First, I learned registers and wrote a simple program to fill a [strings](https://github.com/Mchl-krpch/frame/blob/main/scr/frame.asm) with characters. Then I used a stack to remember registers - so I already wrote a [screen filler](https://github.com/Mchl-krpch/frame/blob/main/scr/bg.asm) in different colors, but this was not enough, so I started using [arrays](https://github.com/Mchl-krpch/frame/blob/main/scr/array.asm) to store much more information
